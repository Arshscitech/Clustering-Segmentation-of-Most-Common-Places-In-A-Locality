# Clustering-Segmentation-of-Most-Common-Places-In-A-Locality
Clustering and Segmentation Of A Place To Find Out The Most Common Places In A City.


The Project Aims to Classify Top Common Places In a Locality or A Neighborhood. It can be useful for people who are travelling to a new city
and they want to know the top common places between the two cities. 

The Project Uses Beautiful Soup To Extract Location Data From Wikipedia, Foursquare api to explore a given area, Folium to plot Geographical Maps, 
Pandas for Data Analysis and Sklearn for clustering.

Since the maps in the TorontoNeighbourhood.ipynb are not visible on github, their images are seperately added. 
The TorontoNeighbourhood.ipynb can be run seperately to visualize the maps.
